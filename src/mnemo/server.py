        "checkpoint progress (e.g. says \"checkpoint this\" or asks to save "
        "where things stand before clearing the session), call memory_add "
        "with type=\"checkpoint\" and content summarizing: the current "
        "state, what's been tried (including things that did NOT work), "
        "and the concrete next step. Write it so that someone with zero "
        "memory of this conversation could resume the work from it alone. "
        "For content that should persist and update in place over time "
        "(a project overview, an evolving bug list, anything that "
        "supersedes its previous version rather than adding to it), use "
        "memory_set_document(slug, content, type) instead of memory_add — "
        "it replaces any existing document with the same slug rather than "
        "creating a duplicate. Use memory_get_document(slug) to read one "
        "back by name. The project overview document's slug should be the "
        "project's own name. There is also memory_search_global(query, "
        "type, k), which searches across every project, not just this "
        "one. Only call it when the user explicitly asks for something "
        "cross-project (e.g. \"what have I done across all my "
        "projects\") — never as a fallback or default when the normal "
        "memory_search, scoped to this project, would do. If any memory "
        "tool call fails because no project is set for this folder, or "
        "the user explicitly asks to set up Mnemo here, call "
        "memory_register_project(name) with a short project id — it "
        "registers the current folder so every future call in it "
        "resolves automatically, immediately, no restart needed."
